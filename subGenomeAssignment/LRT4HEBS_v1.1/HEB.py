# read counts for g1, g2 in different replicates
# length of exonic region of g1, g2
# a row vector of aggregation parameter for each replicate
# a row vector of the total number of mapped reads in each replicate

# so clearly, we need to estimate the aggregation parameter for each replicate first
# aggregation parameter estimate function: get_R(data,plot)
# data: an array whose rows are genes and columns are total number of mapped reads for each replicate. 
# Data should include all genes even if some of them will not be tested for homeologous expression bias.

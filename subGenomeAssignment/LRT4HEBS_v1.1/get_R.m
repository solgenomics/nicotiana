% get_R() - Procedure to determine aggregation parameters (r_i) by 
%           creating N auxillary data sets and rescaling the i-th 
%           replicate by D_j/D_i where D_j is the total depth of the 
%           reference data set j, for j = 1,...,N.
%
%           The values r_i, for i=1,...,N, are then determined by 
%           minimizing the sum of squares error from the rescaled data 
%           set to the curve: 
%               
%                   variance = mean + 1/r_i * mean^2
% 
%           for each rescaled data set i.
%
% Usage:
%   >> [r, D] = get_R(data, plot)
%
% Input:
%       data - An array whose rows are genes and columns are total number
%              of mapped reads for each replicate.  Data should include the
%              data for all genes, even if some (e.g., genes who do not have
%              homeologs) will not be tested.
%
%       plot - optional. 1 = Show plots of the data and fitted curve.
%
% Output:
%       r - an Nx1 vector of aggregation parameters, 
%           where N is the number of replicates.
%       
%       D - The total sequencing depth of each replicate.  This is returned
%           for convenience since it needs to be computed along the way.

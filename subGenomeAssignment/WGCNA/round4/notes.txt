This co-expression network was constructed solely from RNA-seq of leaf.
Including PMI, MaxPlanck and the virus-infected leaf data.
97 datasets in total
mid_leaf rep2 was deleted because it showed as an outlier after clustering
so a total of 96 datasets were used for downstream analysis
soft threshold used: 16
